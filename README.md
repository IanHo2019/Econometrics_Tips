# Econometrics Tips
I first studied Econometrics in the fall of 2020 at [UW-Madison](https://econ.wisc.edu/), USA. The more I learn, the more criticisms of this subject I hear. Some people are annoyed by Econometrics since it (as a statistical tool or just pseudoscience in their eyes) shares the name "*Econ*" with Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, two highly honorable subjects in Econ world. I, as a former first-year Econ PhD student and a currently jobless person, have no ability to argue for/against the honorability of Econometrics. Here, I just want to share some of my notes about beginner-level Econometrics, in case that some new Econometrics learners are (or will be) in need. Comments are always welcomed; my contact is [ianho0815@outlook.com](mailto:ianho0815@outlook.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Econometrics%20Tips).

No matter whether or not Econometrics is worth learning, I sincerely thank Professor [Xiaoxia Shi](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~xshi/) and Professor [Jack Porter](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~jrporter/) (who built up my initial understanding of Econometrics) as well as Professor [Le Wang](https://www.lewangecon.com/) (who refreshed my understanding of probability distribution).
